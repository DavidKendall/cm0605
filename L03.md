## Introduction

<p class="lead">
This lab provides an opportunity to work with the Arm Mbed SDK and the FRDM-K64F
<a href="https://os.mbed.com/components/mbed-Application-Shield/">application
shield</a>. 
</p>

The Arm Mbed SDK was developed as a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and set of
drivers for a wide variety of [embedded systems boards](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/)
based on Arm Cortex-M microcontrollers. The SDK makes it easier for developers
to produce a working system and to reuse their software on different platforms.

## Installing `mbed-cli`

The most efficient way to manage your development with `mbed` is to use
the command line tools, `mbed-cli`. Arm developed `mbed-cli` to manage the
development of [Mbed OS](https://www.mbed.com/en/platform/mbed-os/). 
Arm provides information about `mbed-cli` at
[Arm Mbed CLI](https://os.mbed.com/docs/v5.9/tools/arm-mbed-cli.html). 
The guidance below summarises the instructions for installation and use
on Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop, using the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain.

1. Before proceeding, it's sensible to make sure that your Ubuntu environment
   is up-to-date.

   ```sh
   $ sudo apt update
   $ sudo apt upgrade
   ```
   We are assuming that you are working on a machine where the 
   GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain and `pyocd` have been installed, as 
   described in [lab 1](L01.html). If that is not the case, you should go
   back to [lab 1](L01.html) and follow those instructions before continuing
   here.

1. You should already have `python 2.7` and `pip` installed on your system.
   You can check for `python 2.7` with

     ```sh
     $ python --version
     ```
   You should see a version number, starting with `2.7`.

   Assuming you have `python`, you can check for `pip` with

     ```sh
     $ pip --version
     ```
   If you don't have `python 2.7`, I suggest you download 
   [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) and follow
   the [installation instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux).
   If you already have `python 2.7` but not `pip`, you can install
   it as follows:

     ```sh
     $ sudo apt-get install python-pip
     ```

1. Now install `mbed-cli`

     ```sh
     $ sudo pip install mbed-cli
     ```

1. Configure a global path setting to the compiler tools.

     ```sh
     $ mbed config -G GCC_ARM_PATH ~/.local/packages/gcc-arm/bin
     ```

1. You need to have the version control systems `git` and `hg` installed.
   You can check for them like this...

     ```sh
     $ git --version
     $ hg --version
     ```
   If you need to install `git`, do this

     ```sh
     $ sudo apt-get install git
     ```
   and if you need `hg` (mercurial), do this

     ```sh
     $ sudo apt-get install mercurial
     ```
1. Test your installation by cloning the `mbed-blinky` repository and
   building and running the program. Plug your board into your computer 
   and then execute the following commands.

     ```sh
     $ git clone https://github.com/davidkendall/blinky-mbed
     $ cd blinky-mbed
     $ mbed deploy
     $ mbed compile -t GCC_ARM -m K64F -f
     ```

   You should see the red LED flashing on your K64F board.

## Exercises

   * select using joystick
     - pots
     - accel
     - temp
     - LEDs brightness

1. Profiles - development, debug, release

## Working at home

You'll need to spend about 5 or 6 hours per week, outside of scheduled
classroom time, working on the exercises and doing further reading. The most
important part of this will be the time that you spend programming. You can
configure your own computer to enable you to do any of the work that you would
normally do in the lab. If your own computer has a Linux OS installed, then you
can simply follow the instructions for installing the GNU Arm Embedded
Toolchain and pyOCD.  If you have a Windows or Mac machine, then you should
[install Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html) and create an
Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop guest OS to run on your machine. See [Using
Virtualbox](http://hesabu.net/kf4005/L01.html#using-virtualbox) for guidance.
You can then install the tools, as explained earlier.
